                    <h3>Current Trends in Bot Lane Itemization</h3>
                    <p>The increasing interest in the item "Hullbreaker" within the bot lane, particularly after analyzing Jinx's performance with it. Jinx's build has seen a shift, with her usage of Hullbreaker increasing from 21% to 35% as a second core item, improving her mid-game effectiveness. The rise in popularity of Jinx has led to a corresponding increase in the Jinx-Tahm Kench duo, further emphasizing the effectiveness of this item combination.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Champion Balance and Hotfixes</h3>
                    <p>Warwick and Viktor received nerfs, highlighting the ongoing balancing efforts to maintain competitive integrity within the game. Warwick's nerf includes a reduction in attack damage and growth, while Viktor's growth health and defenses were also adjusted to decrease his overall potency in matches. Tahm Kench, despite not being an issue in previous patches, received a nerf now that his pick and win rates surged in the North American server.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Potential Candidates for Hullbreaker</h3>
                    <p>Draven is identified as a potential user of Hullbreaker. His mechanics and recent buffs allow him to adapt well to this new build style. Varus is also identified as another champion that might benefit from Hullbreaker due to his ability to adopt diverse build paths. Ashe can also be considered for her viability with the item, particularly her ability to enhance her scaling and survivability within team compositions.</p>
